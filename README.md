atl-pd-data
===========

Tool for aggregation, viewing, and analysis of Atlanta Police Department crime data on a local system.

This tool was started by rck109d over a couple of years in spare time and so currently has some perculiarities of design and issues with ease of use.

A local MongoDB instance is assumed at all times as well as a local Tor proxy during aggregation from APD servers.
